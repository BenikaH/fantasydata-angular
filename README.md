# Fantasy Data Angular 
This is a responsive full-stack web app that allows users to get their fantasy football team rosters optimized. This is accomplished through calls to the fantasydata API. 

# Introduction 
The primary focus of the Fantasy Data Angular web-app is for fantasy football fans to easily set their strongest roster on a weekly basis. The optimizer will take a user's full roster and organize the starters in a way that they can accumulate the most project points to help them win their matchups!

# How it works 
Users will input their team into the app. After the team is inputed the user will press the optimize button, where they will be taken to their optimized roster. This roster will compare the user's players against each other and using fantasydata's projected weekly points the best roster will be generated. It is then up to the user to update their roster on the fantasy sports site they use manually.
